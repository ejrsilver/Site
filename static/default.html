                        <h1>Hi There!</h1>
                        <p>My name is Ethan, and I'm a computer engineering student at Queen's University,
                                and a Software Developer at the Centre for Advanced Computing.</p>
                        <p>I work in web and application development, primarily as a backend engineer. I've worked in a
                                variety
                                of
                                languages for multiple platforms, and I'm comfortable working in a fast-paced
                                environment. I also
                                have
                                some experience in education and curriculum development working both in classrooms and
                                online.</p>
