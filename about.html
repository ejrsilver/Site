        <a name="seniorband"></a>
        <br>
        <h5>Senior Band</h5>

        <p>The Kingston Police Pipe Band consists of over 40 performing pipers and drummers.</p>

        <p>The band leadership is comprised of experienced players who have seen success on the biggest competition stages of Pipe Band. These stages include the North American Pipe Band Championships in Maxville Ontario, and the World Pipe Band Championships in Glasgow Scotland.</p>

        <h5>Youth Band</h5>

        <p>The Kingston Police Youth Pipe Band is a positive organization for youth under the age of 19, providing a safe and nurturing space for students to learn.</p>

        <a name="community"></a>
        <br>
        <h5>Community Engagement</h5>

        <p>The Kingston Police Pipe Band has brought together people from all different backgrounds culturally, professionally, and socially. The various skills and experiences of these members were key to forming a successful organization. The organization has been developed with the following six principles:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Respect</li>
          <li>Integrity</li>
          <li>Professionalism</li>
          <li>Partnership</li>
          <li>Leadership</li>
          <li>Excellence</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>These six pillars provide the framework in which the band operates, achieves goals, and enhances public confidence. It is how each of these pillars are integrated which ultimately provides the amount of positive change within our community.</p>

        <p>Integration of the six pillars can be done by ensuring that the instructors collaborate, innovate, and promote well-being. It is through collaboration that the instructors set meaningful and dynamic goals for our students to strive towards; all the while providing the physical and mental support to achieve excellence. Music exposure does more than provide a creative outlet; it provides mental, emotional, and educational benefits such as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Improving reading skills, increasing vocabulary and language ability.</li>
          <li>Developing listening skills, aural awareness, abstract thinking and imagination.</li>
          <li>Increasing memory skills, building concentration and attention span.</li>
          <li>Building social skills, self-discipline, patience and improving behavior.</li>
          <li>Building confidence and emotional growth and making a happier child.</li>
          <li>Performing in front of crowds, teaching kids to deal with nerves and stressful presentation situations like interviews.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We are partnered with the Boys and Girls Club of Kingston & Area at the Robert Meek Youth Centre where we have our regular practices and lessons. Experienced members of the Kingston Police Pipe Band also volunteer their time providing young people facing barriers with the opportunity to participate in music during their after-school programming. Students receive practice equipment, participate in weekly lessons with instructors, and develop their musical talents and leadership skills, all while focusing on completing an accredited music program free of charge. Through a generous grant from the Rotary Club of Cataraqui-Kingston, we were able to purchase all the of the practice instruments needed to provide lessons without cost to the students.</p>

        <p>Pipers and Drummers under 19 years of age in Kingston & Area are brought to together to practice, perform and compete.</p>

        <h5>Our Story</h5>

        <p>After graduating from teachers’ college in 2015, Pipe Major John McKay had a vision of a pipe band for youth in Kingston. Through mutual friends he connected with Lead Drummer Scott Nicholson in April 2016 and they quickly realized that they shared the same values of:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Providing free lessons</li>
          <li>Reaching out to parts of the community who don’t traditionally have access</li>
          <li>Forming a community performance and competitive pipe band</li>
          <li>Forming community partnerships such as the ones forged with the Kingston Police Services and the Boys and Girls Club of Kingston</li>
          <li>Bringing in skilled instructors for different instruments</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>A Band is Formed</h6>

        <p>The Kingston Pipe Band was formed. The lean years….
        Registered not for profit….</p>

        <h6>A Partnership is Made</h6>

        <p>The Kingston Police Pipe Band was official in 2018 and the band exploded. Uniforms. Equipment. Community engagements…..</p>

        <h6>Making More Connections</h6>

        <p>Almost as soon as the band formed its association with the Kingston Police Service, we entered into our second most important partnership – with the Boys and Girls Club of Kingston. Using space at the Bagot Street Location, we offer weekly lessons to all interested community members. We practice in the gym. In addition, our members volunteer to provide pipe and drum and music lessons to BGCK members in their after-school music program. In our first year, the BGCK presented us with a volunteer award.</p>

        <h6>Developing a Youth Band</h6>

        <p>After providing lessons for a couple of years and gaining new experienced players, we were able to form the start of our Kingston Police Youth Pipe Band.</p>

        <h6>Where we are today</h6>

        <h5>Pipe Major John McKay</h5>

        <p>John began his piping at age 9 and began his band career at age 12 with the Braemar pipe band of St. Catharines. Following the collapse of Braemar, John took his talents to the Niagara Regional Police Pipe band where he was a member from 2007-2015. In the later years John acted as the Pipe Sergeant of the band acting under Peter Mackenzie.</p>

        <p>In 2012 John began taking his tuition from Michael Grey, ultimately leading to him joining the ranks of Toronto Police Grade 1 in September of 2013. John is still currently a member of the Toronto Police Pipe Band and takes great pride in playing next to the now Double Gold Medalist Ian K. MacDonald.</p>

        <p>In March of 2016, John travelled to Scotland to teach at the National Piping Centre alongside a handful of past gold medalists. This experience ignited his passion for teaching and has heavily influenced the direction in which he wishes to take the teaching program he has been working on with the Kingston Police.</p>

        <h5>Lead Drummer Scott Nicholson</h5>

        <p>Scott was born and raised in Kingston, Ontario and has been teaching and leading pipe bands locally for 25 years. His students have achieved success at all levels including first prize at the World Solo Drumming Championships and some going on to play in top level drum corps and Professional Solo competitions. In 2010, he led the local Rob Roy Pipe Band to a first-place finish at the North American Championships (grade 3) and a top six finish at the World Pipe Band Championships (grade 3B) that same year. Scott led Rob Roy to Champion Supreme status in 2010 and 2011 (grade 2). Scott also has some experience performing and competing as a piper. 
        He has personally won many professional level solo drumming prizes and has played in Grade 1 bands such as the Toronto Police and the 78th Fraser Highlanders. These bands gave Scott the experience of playing with many different leading drummers including Michael Hunter, John Fisher, Drew Duthart, Doug Stronach, Craig Stewart, and with Pipe Majors Bill Livingstone, Ian K. MacDonald and Sean McKeowan.</p>

        <p>During that time, the 78th Frasers won many major band and drum corps prizes including the Canadian, American, and North American Championships on numerous occasions. In addition, Scott has numerous years of experience competing in Scotland at the World Pipe Band Championships with several top six finishes at the highest level (grade 1). In addition to competitions, Scott has travelled the world performing with bands on stage in concert and recording several albums live and in studio.</p>

        <p>In 2008, Scott was an original member of the famous Spirit of Scotland Pipe Band which was the subject of the documentary movie “On The Day.” The band reunited in 2011 for a sold-out concert at the prestigious Royal Glasgow Concert Hall.</p>

        <p>Scott is currently the leading drummer and instructor with the Kingston Police Pipe Band, an organization that he started with Pipe Major John McKay in 2016.</p>

        <p>Outside of playing, Scott is a Certified drumming judge and was a member of the Music Committee with the Pipers & Pipe Band Society of Ontario. Away from drumming he volunteers with coaching Little League Baseball and sits as a board member for the local league.</p>
